The overall empathy problem here lies in the complexity and lack of visibility and structure in tracking skills and learner progress, affecting all three stakeholders: the training manager, trainers, and learners. Each of these roles encounters specific difficulties due to unsuitable tools, such as Excel, and a growing need for centralization and clear visualization of information.

### Summary of the overall problem :

1. **For the Training Manager** : He needs an overview to effectively manage learners. Manual management overloads it and complicates the organization of information, which limits its ability to monitor and structure skills development.

2. **For Trainers** : They lack suitable tools to assess and monitor learners' progress. The lack of a centralized, intuitive place to view skills makes their task frustrating and inefficient, preventing them from effectively communicating feedback to learners.

3. **For Learners** : The difficulty in monitoring their skills and projects often makes them lost and demotivated. They need a clear, organized, and accessible workspace where they can view their progress, get feedback, and access resources.

In summary, the overall problem is a common need for **centralization and visualization** information relating to skills, allowing smoother management, effective progress monitoring, and motivating support for learners. An integrated and structured tool would meet these needs by improving communication, clarity, and motivation of all parties.
